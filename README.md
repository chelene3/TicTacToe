This is a repository for a simple Tic Tac Toe mobile game. As I learn to develop with Xcode and Swift, this is one of the sample projects that I am trying on my own as I develop with other lessons. 

Goals:
1. Create a visually-correct game (adheres to formatting and can rotate the screen)
2. Make the game interactive for two people on one device
3. Allow a flip back and forth between players in terms of color/Xs and Os
4. Able to end the game if someone wins
